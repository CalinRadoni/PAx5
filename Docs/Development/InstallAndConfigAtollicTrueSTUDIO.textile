h1. Install Atollic TrueSTUDIO.

According to the official docs you can have more then one version installed.
I allways use different directories for each version installed (ex.: @D:\Programs\TrueSTUDIO for ARM 7.1.0@)

h1. Workspace configuration

Let's say the full name of the @PAx5\SW@ directory is @D:\Projects\PAx5\SW@.

h2. Start with an empty workspace

By deleting the @D:\Projects\PAx5\SW\.metadata@__ directory you start with an empty workspace.

Open Atollic TrueSTUDIO and select as workspace directory @D:\Projects\PAx5\SW@.

h2. Import the projects

Launch the import window with *File -> Open Projects from File System...*
Click the *Directory...* button and select @D:\Projects\PAx5\SW@ directory.
Select only the projects and click the *Finish* button.

h1. Done
